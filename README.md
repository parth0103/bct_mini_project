# Land Registry Application using Ethereum Blockchain

## Abstract

Developed a decentralized application using Blockchain which could overcome the short-comings of the existing process of land registry. Through Blockchain, it is possible to keep track of how property changes hand to hand. For buyers, sellers and Government registrars, it is easier to transfer the land ownership from a seller to a new buyer without any intermediaries.  It provides immutability, auditability, traceability, and anonymity features which attracts the people around the globe to implement its decentralization feature in the land registry process.  It also accelerates the process of registration and provides transparency to the system.
